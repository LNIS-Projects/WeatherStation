# WeatherStation
This project is a personal Bluetooth weather station utilizing the ESP32 MCU. The ECE Weather Station collects temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure measurements and pushes the data to your smartphone through the custom app.

<h2>The ECE Weather Station</h2>
The ECE Weather Station is based around an Espressif ESP32 microcontroller, mounted on an [Adafruit HUZZAH32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405) development board. Weather measurement peripherals include the [DHT11](https://www.mouser.com/ds/2/758/DHT11-Technical-Data-Sheet-Translated-Version-1143054.pdf) temperature and humidity sensor, and the [BMP280 barometric](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/bst/products/all_products/bmp280) pressure sensor. A lithium-ion battery can be connected to the device and charged through the \( \mu \)USB terminal. 

## About Us
The ECE Weather Station was designed by students from the Laboratory for NanoIntegrated Systems (LNIS) at the University of Utah.
